- Timer decrements at $A69A: SBC #$01
- Decremented value written to $E803 (POKEY sound register)
- Creates descending/ascending frequency sweep
- Timer completes when reaching $A0 (comparison at $A695)

SOUND CHARACTERISTICS:
- Base frequency: ~5.6 kHz (POKEY value $A0)
- Duration: ~0.12-0.15 seconds
- Envelope: Fast attack, quick decay (chirrup characteristic)
- Waveform: Square wave (POKEY synthesis)
- Frequency sweep: Ascending chirrup pattern

TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
- Enemy spawning/appearance
- Possibly level transitions
- Different from firing sounds ($AC = 172)
