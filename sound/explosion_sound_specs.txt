K-Razy Shoot-Out Explosion Sound - Technical Specifications
======================================================================

ROM ANALYSIS:
Explosion sounds are triggered when enemies are destroyed and set to inactive.
The ROM code at $B50D uses hardware random register for noise generation:

$B50D: LDA $E80A  ; Load hardware random register (noise source)
$B510: AND #$F0   ; Keep upper 4 bits
$B512: ORA #$08   ; Set bit 3
$B514: STA $08,X  ; Store processed random value

SOUND CHARACTERISTICS:
- White noise style explosion effects
- Duration: 0.2-0.3 seconds
- Fast attack, exponential decay envelope
- Multiple frequency bands (high/mid/low)
- POKEY-style square wave noise generation
- Based on hardware random register bit manipulation

TRIGGER CONDITIONS:
- Enemy destruction (when set to inactive $FF)
- Player missile hits enemy
- Collision detection confirms hit
